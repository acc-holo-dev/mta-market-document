# MTA Market — Project Status

**Last updated:** 2025-01-09  
**Current phase:** MVP / Pre-Production

---

## Executive Summary

MTA Market is a DRM-protected marketplace for MTA:SA server resources. The project has completed initial implementation of core features (backend API, frontend, Docker deployment, CI/CD) but **is not ready for production** until critical security issues are resolved and production gates are completed.

**Key metrics:**

- ✅ 38 backend API endpoints implemented
- ✅ 5 frontend pages (Next.js 15)
- ✅ Docker + CI/CD pipeline operational
- ⚠️ **7 of 17 P0 security issues resolved** (see below)
- ⏳ Production payment flow incomplete
- ⏳ DRM v2 cryptographic protocol pending

---

## ✅ What Works (Implemented)

### Backend API

- **Authentication:** Discord OAuth2 + JWT (access/refresh tokens)
- **Resources:** CRUD operations, versioning, seller dashboard
- **Purchases:** Order creation, YooKassa integration skeleton
- **DRM:** Basic license generation, server activation
- **Admin:** Resource moderation, user management, review moderation
- **Financial:** Transaction logging (basic)

### Frontend

- **Pages:** Home, catalog, resource detail, dashboard, auth callback
- **UI:** TailwindCSS + lucide-react, responsive design
- **State:** Zustand + TanStack Query

### Infrastructure

- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 + Prisma 8
- **Cache:** Redis 7
- **Deployment:** Docker Compose (dev + prod), GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx with SSL, rate limiting, security headers

## ⚠️ P0 Security Issues (Critical)

### ✅ Resolved (commits 2e050a0, 5100abb, 0c6f5f3, b83aa60) — 14/17 done

1. **P0-01:** Payment bypass via `/purchases/:id/complete` — **REMOVED**
2. **P0-02:** YooKassa webhook — **IDEMPOTENT + PROVIDER VERIFICATION**
3. **P0-03:** ID type consistency — **RESOLVED: Int PK, stale schema removed (ADR-014)**
4. **P0-04:** Missing input validation — **ZOD SCHEMAS ADDED (resources, purchases, reviews)**
5. **P0-05:** Seller direct PUBLISHED status — **BLOCKED**
6. **P0-06:** Tokens in OAuth redirect URL — **MOVED TO COOKIES**
7. **P0-07:** Refresh token HttpOnly cookie — **IMPLEMENTED**
8. **P0-08:** Password reset GET → POST — **N/A (Discord OAuth only, requirements documented)**
9. **P0-09:** JWT fallback secret — **REMOVED (throws on startup)**
10. **P0-10:** S3 signed downloads — **IMPLEMENTED (GetObjectCommand + TTL)**
11. **P0-11:** DRM v1 uses symmetric AES-GCM — **DOCUMENTED (v2 pending)**
12. **P0-12:** Webhook idempotency — **PaymentProviderEvent table added**
13. **P0-13:** Financial ledger — **settlePurchaseRevenue() with fee invariants**
14. **P0-16:** README overstated status — **CORRECTED**
15. **P0-17:** Stale architecture docs — **schema.prisma removed, ADR-014 added**

### ⏳ Remaining P0 Issues — 3 left (requires implementation before closed beta)

16. **P0-14:** Sandbox upload validation — **REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTED (SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md)**
17. **P0-15:** Observability (tracing/metrics/logging) — **REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTED (SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md)**

## ⏳ Production Gates (Not Ready)

The following must be completed before production launch:

### Security & Payments

- [ ] Complete YooKassa production flow (IP whitelist + Basic Auth)
- [ ] Implement provider_payment_events idempotency table
- [ ] Add Zod input validation across all endpoints
- [ ] Fix ID type consistency (migrate to String CUID or keep Int with correct types)
- [ ] Implement S3 signed URLs for artifact downloads
- [ ] Add artifact signature verification

### DRM v2

- [ ] Keypair-based license signing (RSA/Ed25519)
- [ ] Public key distribution to MTA Guard module
- [ ] License signature verification in Lua
- [ ] Revocation list distribution

### Financial Integrity

- [ ] Double-entry ledger (transactions + journal_entries + ledger_accounts)
- [ ] Seller payout reconciliation
- [ ] Platform fee accounting
- [ ] Audit trail for all money movements

### Moderation & Safety

- [ ] Sandbox resource validation (static analysis + MTA load test)
- [ ] Automated malware scanning
- [ ] Manual review workflow for published resources
- [ ] DMCA takedown process

### Observability

- [ ] OpenTelemetry tracing
- [ ] Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Structured logging (JSON)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry or equivalent)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring

### Testing

- [ ] Integration tests (purchase flow, DRM activation)
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [ ] Load testing (YooKassa webhook handling)
- [ ] Security testing (OWASP Top 10)

## 🔧 Known Technical Debt

1. **Type safety:** Many route handlers use `any` types
2. **Error handling:** Inconsistent error responses
3. **Rate limiting:** Global limits, not per-user/per-endpoint
4. **Database queries:** N+1 queries in `/purchases/my`
5. **Frontend auth:** Access token stored in memory (ephemeral, good), but refresh flow needs CSRF protection
6. **Logs:** Console.log instead of structured logging
7. **Migrations:** No Prisma migration history (schema only)

## 📊 Architecture Overview

### Current (Stage 7)

```
[Frontend: Next.js 15]
       ↓ HTTP
[Nginx reverse proxy]
       ↓
[Backend: Express + Prisma]
       ↓
[PostgreSQL 16] + [Redis 7]
```

### Target (Production)

```
[Frontend: Next.js 15]
       ↓ HTTPS + CORS
[Nginx: SSL, rate limit, WAF]
       ↓
[Backend: Express + Prisma + OpenTelemetry]
       ↓
[PostgreSQL 16: ACID transactions]
[Redis 7: sessions + rate limits]
[S3/R2: signed artifacts]
[Sentry: error tracking]
[Prometheus: metrics]
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do Before Production

1. **Do not accept real money** — YooKassa integration incomplete
2. **Do not deploy to public internet** — P0 security issues remain
3. **Do not trust user-uploaded artifacts** — no sandbox validation
4. **Do not promise refunds** — financial ledger incomplete
5. **Do not scale horizontally** — session store not distributed-ready
